#' Remove patients from the cohort.
#'
#' @description Each patient is identied through its id (\code{patientID});
#' with this function, you can remove patients, which consists in removing  data
#' and trees. If you have fit the models or clustered the cohort,
#' you must re-run the analyses after this modification; for this reason,
#' any previous result from those analyses is cancelled from the returned object.
#'
#' Notice also that some drivers might be removed by this function.
#'
#' @param x A REVOLVER cohort.
#' @param patientID Id of the patient to remove. It can be a vector.
#'
#' @return A modified cohort without the required patients.
