Description: REVOLVER is a package that implements a statistical model to determine trajectories of
  repeated evolution from multi-region sequencing data of human cancers. The package implements functions
  to process data from large cohorts, and determine different types of phylogenetic trees from the input
  data of each sequenced patients. The package provides also several functions to plot the data, and
  determine clusters of tumours that share repeated trajectories; this provides a method to
  stratify cancer patients for the way their tumour evolve, reconciling tumour heterogeneity both
  between and within patients.
